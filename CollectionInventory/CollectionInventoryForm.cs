//Purpose: This was initially my final project for my .NET Application development course at
//Chippewa Valley Technical College. But the project was initially written in Visual Basic,
//here I am converting the project to C#. Collection_Inventory is a .NET app written in C# that
//allows multiple users to inventory their various collections of different objects ' and add
//various items into that collection. Use a database to store this information.

namespace CollectionInventory
{
    public partial class CollectionInventoryForm : Form
    {
        public CollectionInventoryForm()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void CollectionInventoryForm_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

        }
    }
}
